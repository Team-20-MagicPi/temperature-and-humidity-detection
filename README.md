Raspberry Pi temperature and humidity sensor module
Read sensor data
Low-cost DHT temperature and humidity sensor has a general basic function, speed is not fast, but for the basic data recording enthusiasts are very suitable.DHT sensor is composed of two parts, namely capacitive humidity sensor and thermistor.There's also a very basic chip inside that can do some analog-to-digital conversion and read digital signals of temperature and humidity.The digital signal is easily read with any microcontroller.

DHT22 main features:
3.3 to 5V power supply and I/O
 Maximum current during conversion is 2.5mA
 Applicable to 0-100% humidity readings with accuracy of 2-5%
 Suitable for temperature readings from -40 to 125°C with accuracy of ±0.5°C
 Sampling rate not exceeding 0.5 Hz (every 2 seconds)
1, Pin 1 -- Vcc ==3.3 V/5v

2, Pin 2 -- Data ==GPIO 13

3. Pin 3 -- Unconnected
